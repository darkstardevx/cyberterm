# 📟 cyberterm

[![CI](https://github.com/darkstardevx/cyberterm/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/darkstardevx/cyberterm/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Release](https://github.com/darkstardevx/cyberterm/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/darkstardevx/cyberterm/actions/workflows/release.yml)

`Rust` · `wgpu` · `alacritty_terminal` · `glyphon`

**A GPU-rendered terminal emulator.** Real PTY handling via
`alacritty_terminal`, real glyph rendering via `glyphon` (cosmic-text +
etagere on a wgpu pipeline), 12 built-in Kitty-format themes, and a
in-terminal theme menu — no Electron, no bundled shell.

**[darkstardevx.github.io/cyberterm](https://darkstardevx.github.io/cyberterm/)**

## 📦 Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darkstardevx/cyberterm/main/install.sh | sh
```

Downloads the latest release for your platform (Linux or macOS, x86_64
or aarch64), verifies its SHA-256 checksum, and installs `cyberterm` to
`~/.local/bin`. Linux needs the usual desktop GL/X11/Wayland libraries
already present — nothing extra to install for the binary itself. Or
build from source with `cargo build --release`.

## 🚀 Commands

```bash
cyberterm                     # launch the terminal
cyberterm +list-themes        # list every theme found in ~/.config/cyberterm/themes
cyberterm +set-theme <name>   # switch theme and save it as the default
cyberterm +edit-theme --create-theme <category> <folder> <name>
cyberterm +edit-theme --view-theme <category> <folder> <name>
cyberterm +edit-theme --remove-theme <category> <folder> <name>
cyberterm +set-opacity --custom=0.85
cyberterm +list-termkeys
```

12 curated Kitty-syntax themes ship built-in (`~/.config/cyberterm/themes/*.conf`)
and load unmodified — anything pulled straight from
[kovidgoyal/kitty-themes](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty-themes) drops in
next to them with zero conversion. `+edit-theme` writes your own custom
themes as JSON under a `category/folder/` layout alongside the built-ins;
the theme registry reads both shapes at startup. Press `Ctrl+Shift+T` in
the terminal itself to open the same theme picker without leaving the
session.

## ⚙️ Rendering

Text is drawn by `glyphon` (cosmic-text shaping + etagere glyph atlas) on
a wgpu render pipeline; per-cell background color (selection highlights,
`ls --color` entries, etc.) is a separate hand-rolled quad pass, since
glyphon only rasterizes glyphs. Window opacity (`+set-opacity`) fades
cell backgrounds only — text stays fully opaque, matching how
Ghostty/Kitty/Alacritty do transparency.

## 🗺 Known limitations

- **Paste isn't wired up.** Copy (mouse selection, or an app inside the
  terminal writing an OSC 52 clipboard-set sequence) works and goes to
  the system clipboard. Reading the system clipboard back — a keybinding
  paste, or an app's OSC 52 clipboard-*read* query — currently returns
  empty. Worth knowing before you rely on it for a paste-heavy workflow.
- No tabs, no split panes. One window, one PTY session.
- No syntax highlighting inside the terminal buffer itself (that's a
  shell/pager/editor concern, not a terminal emulator's).

## 🚦 Quality gate

```bash
./scripts/release-gates quick   # fmt + check + clippy
./scripts/release-gates full    # quick + tests + strict rustdoc
```

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for what each step checks and why
the render/PTY/input path can't be covered by automated tests.
