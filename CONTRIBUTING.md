# 🤝 Contributing to Cyberterm

`Rust` · `wgpu` · `alacritty_terminal` · `glyphon` · `winit`

Cyberterm is a single bin crate, not a workspace, so this gate is a scaled-
down version of the multi-crate one used elsewhere in this org (see
[diagprint](https://github.com/darkstardevx/diagprint) for the full
workspace/MSRV-matrix version): no per-package arrays, no publish step (a
terminal emulator binary isn't published to crates.io), and no pinned-MSRV
re-run (that matters for a *library* other people compile with their own
toolchain constraints — a bin only needs to build with whatever toolchain
built it).

## 🚦 Quality gate

Run before every commit that touches `src/`:

```bash
./scripts/release-gates quick   # fmt + check + clippy -- fast, run constantly
./scripts/release-gates full    # quick + tests + strict rustdoc
```

<details>
<summary>What each step does and what a failure usually means</summary>

| Step | Command | What it means if it fails |
|---|---|---|
| Whitespace | `git diff --check` | Trailing whitespace or conflict markers snuck into a diff |
| Format | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` | Code doesn't match the project's `rustfmt` style — run `cargo fmt --all` to fix |
| Check | `cargo check --all-targets --all-features` | Doesn't compile (including tests) |
| Clippy | `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` | A real lint issue — this repo treats every clippy warning as an error, no exceptions |
| Tests | `cargo test --bin cyberterm --all-features` | A unit test regressed — mostly the pure, headlessly-testable logic (theme file parsing, key-to-PTY-byte encoding) since the GUI/GPU/shell path itself needs a real window and can't run in CI |
| Docs | `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --all-features --bin cyberterm` | A broken doc link or invalid rustdoc syntax |

</details>

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) mirrors the same checks in separate jobs
(`quality`, `test`) rather than shelling out to the script — the script is
what you run locally before pushing so CI isn't the first signal.

## 🖥️ Why some things can't be tested in CI

Cyberterm opens a real GPU window and spawns a real shell over a PTY. Neither
of those can be driven headlessly in CI or a sandboxed agent shell — there's
no display, no GPU adapter, and no interactive keyboard focus. What *is*
tested automatically:

- [x] Theme file parsing (`src/theme.rs`) — real Kitty `.conf` syntax, ANSI-
      convention fallback when named keys are absent, directory scanning
- [x] Key-to-PTY-byte encoding (`src/keys.rs`) — the pure logical-key →
      escape-sequence mapping, independent of any actual keyboard event
- [ ] Actually rendering a frame, spawning a shell, or receiving keystrokes —
      these need a human to launch the binary and look at the window

When you touch the render/PTY/input path, say so in your PR description and
note what manual verification you did (launched it, typed a command, ran
`ls --color`/`vim`/`htop`, resized the window, etc.) — that's the closest
thing to a test for that code today.
